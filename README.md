# StudyLair Recommender System

This Python recommender system was implemented by me for a project with 3 of my friends where I had the responsibilities of an ML engineer. The project was designed as a MERN stack application that helped students find study buddies.
The recommender system code is attached as an interactive Jupyter notebook with sample input & output to this repo.

The systemâ€™s script includes 3 phases: data preprocessing, user-vector representation, and similarity analysis.
