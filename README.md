# StudyLair Recommender System

This Python recommender system was implemented by me for a collaborative project with 3 of my friends in January 2021. The project was developed as a MERN stack application that helped students find study buddies. Unfortunately, StudyLair wasn't finished because of an internal conflict between 2 team members. 

The recommender algorithm however was fully completed. The code for the system is attached to this repo.
