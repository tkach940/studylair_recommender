# StudyLair Recommender System

This Python recommender system was implemented by 3 of my friends and me for a collaborative project in January 2021. The project was designed as a MERN stack application that helped students find study buddies.
The code for the recommender system is attached to this repo.

The systemâ€™s script has 3 phases: data preprocessing, user-vector representation, and similarity analysis.
